Artist Representation at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago
The Museum of Contemporary Art, known as the MCA, is a renowned institution in Chicago,
celebrated for its dedication to contemporary and avant-garde art across diverse mediums. It
ranks among the world's largest and most comprehensive contemporary art museums, exhibiting
a collection of over 2,750 artworks. My role in this project involved organizing data from a vast
JSON file containing information more than 10,000 artists whose works are displayed at the
museum. This data was carefully processed into a structured dataframe, and I developed
functions to create informative Sankey diagrams. Sankey diagrams are valuable tools for
visualizing the flow of values between sources and targets. In this context, they provided insights
into diversity, inclusion, and gender representation in the art world by illustrating the connections
between the artists’ nationality, gender, and decade of birth. The analysis revealed that American
artists were most prominent in the museum's collection, followed by German, French, British,
Italian, and Japanese artists. Artists born in the 1930s dominated, with notable representation
from the 1940s and 1960s. Other birth decades included the 1920s, 1950s, 1970s, 1880s, 1890s,
1870s, 1860s, 1900s, and 1910s. The visualizations also depicted that majority of featured artists
were male. A closer look into the multilayer sankey diagram highlight the underrepresentation of
female and international artists. For instance, the only female artists represented are shown to be
primarily American. Mainly, female artists represented in the museum are born in or after the
1930’s. Similar to this is male artists with nationalities beside American. Overall, the sankey
diagrams touch on a deeper-rooted problem which is that the MCA and potentially other
prominent museums in the U.S reflect a significant lack of racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in
their collection. These results signify the ongoing challenge of achieving gender balance and
inclusion in the art world.
